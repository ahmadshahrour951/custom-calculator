# custom-calculator

This calculator idea was made by Michell Hudson. It's a simple tool to calculate volumes of different shapes with different sizes. In this case we are only looking at 3 shapes: cones, spheres, and cylinders. Once you input all the information, then all you need to do is submit. Please note, height parameter will not change the sphere shape.
